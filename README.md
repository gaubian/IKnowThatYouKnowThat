# IKnowThatYouKnowThat

The goal is to solve the following problem using Prolog:

Two numbers between 1 and 200 are chosen, P is given their product and S their sum.
* P says he doesn't know which number they are
* S responds he knew that
* P says that, now, he can say which were the original numbers
* Now, S also knows which were these original numbers

What are those numbersÂ ?
